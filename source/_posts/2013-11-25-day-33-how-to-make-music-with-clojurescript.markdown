I am working on a small project to practice
[change ringing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_ringing) with
ClojureScript.

As always when starting a new project I have been consulting
approximately a million resources to get started. So I thought I'd
collect them all together in one place instead of searching for them
over and over forever.

### Getting started with ClojureScript


* [Empty ClojureScript project, with instructions](https://github.com/maryrosecook/barecljs),
    from [Mary](https://github.com/maryrosecook)
* [CLJSFiddle](http://cljsfiddle.net/), for trying out ClojureScript
  snippets
* [Explanation of cljs/js interop](http://gist.io/7610122), from
  [Zach](https://github.com/zachallaun)

### Web Audio

There's a newish API for synthesizing sound in the browser called the
WebAudio API.

* [Some demos](http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/)
* [Very cool player piano app](https://github.com/liamgriffiths/music-box)
   by Liam Griffiths, a Hacker Schooler in my batch. You will have to
   run it on your computer but it will be worth it.
* [Hum](https://github.com/mathias/hum), a small ClojureScript wrapper
  around the WebAudio API. If you want to test if it works in your
  browser, try
  [this CLJSFiddle](http://cljsfiddle.net/fiddle/jvns.cljs-music-test).
  It should make an annoying noise when you run it..

### Sound samples

If you don't want to synthesize music, there are tons of samples on
[freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/)

* [Freesound API documentation](http://www.freesound.org/docs/api/)
* [Get a Freesound API key](www.freesound.org/api/apply/). It says
  "Apply", but it gives it to you automatically.
* [freesound.js](https://github.com/g-roma/freesound.js), a JS library
  for working with freesound
* [IDs for a set of piano samples](https://github.com/overtone/overtone/blob/master/src/overtone/samples/piano.clj),
  from the Overtone project.
* [JSFiddle demoing the Freesound API](http://jsfiddle.net/jvns/J4sW2/).
  Scroll to the bottom to see the actual code; I copied all of `freesound.js`
  into it. It should make a piano sound when you run it.
