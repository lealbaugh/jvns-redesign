Yesterday and today I made the Git pictures from Wednesday's post into a
website!

How it works: You tell it the sequence of git commands you've ever
executed. It gives you back pretty pictures. Like this fantastic picture
of [Selena Decklemann](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/)'s workflow! I
really like how this one makes it clear when you'd want to use rebase
(in between commit and push), or stash (before checkout and pull). It
is a thing of beauty.
