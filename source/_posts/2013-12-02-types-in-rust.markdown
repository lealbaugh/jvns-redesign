I found understanding Rust types really confusing, so I wrote up a
small tutorial for myself in an attempt to understand some of them.
This is by no means exhaustive. There is a
[types section](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/rust.html#type-system)
in the manual, but it has nowhere near enough examples.

This assumes that you've read the sections about
[owned](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial.html#ownership)
and
[borrowed](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial.html#borrowed-pointers)
pointers in the Rust tutorial, but not much else.

I'm not talking about managed pointers (`@`) at all. A lot of the
difficulty with Rust types is that the language is constantly
changing, so this will likely be out of date soon.

First, a few preliminaries: it's easier to play with types if you have
a REPL and can interactively check the types of objects. This isn't
really possible in Rust, but there are workarounds.

## To start out: some help

### How to get a Rust REPL

There is no working Rust REPL. However, you can use
[this script](http://sprunge.us/KaPE) to approximate one -- it
compiles what you put into it and prints the result. You can't use the
results of what you did previously, though. Save as `rustci`.

### How to find the type of a variable

If you want to find the type of a variable `y`, run:

```rust
let x: () = y;
```

This will generate a compiler error with the type of `y`. This is a
hack, but as I understand it it's the best workaround for now.

For example, to find the type of a function in our fake REPL, you can
do

```rust
fn f() {}; let x: () = f;
```

This will give us the error:

```
error: mismatched types: expected `()` but found `fn()` (expected () but found extern fn)
```

which tells us that the type of `f` is `fn()`. Yay!

## The types!


### Primitive types

This is an incomplete list.

Integers (signed and unsigned): `int`, `uint`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`

Floats: `f32`, `f64`

Booleans: `bool`

**Primitive type examples**

```rust
let x: uint = 2;
let y: u8 = 40;
let z: f32 = abc;
```

### Vectors

There are 3 possible types for a vector of `u8`: `[u8, ..N]`, `&[u8]`, `~[u8]`

`[u8]` by itself is not a type.

`[u8, ..5]` is a fixed-size vector of `u8` of length 5.


**Vector Examples**

```rust
// Fixed size vector
let x : [uint, ..10] = [5, ..10]; // [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

// Create a variable size owned vector
let mut numbers1 : ~[uint]= ~[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Create a variable size borrowed vector. This is also called a "vector slice".
let mut numbers2 : &[uint]= &[0, 1, 2];
let mut slice: &[uint] = numbers1.slice(0, 3);
```

### Strings and characters

Some string types include: `&str`, `~str`, and `&'static str`.

A string is represented internally as a vector of bytes. However,
`str` by itself is *not* a type, and there are no fixed-size strings.
You can convert any of the string types to a byte vector `&[u8]`.

`char` is a 32-bit Unicode character. 

**String Examples**

```rust
use std::option::Option;
// Static string
let hello: &'static str = "Hello!";
let hello2: &str = "Hello!";

// Owned string
let owned_hello: ~str = ~"Hello!";

// Borrowed string
let borrowed_hello = &owned_hello;

// Character
let c: char = 'a';

// Indexing into a string gives you a byte, not a character.
let byte: u8 = owned_hello[1];

// You need to create an iterator to get a character from a string.
let c: Option<char> = owned_hello.chars().nth(2);

// Switch to the string's representation as bytes
let bytes: &[u8] = owned_hello.as_bytes();
```

### Functions

For a function `fn(a: A) -> B`

`fn(A)->B` is a type, So are `&(fn(A)->B)`, `~(fn(A)->B)`, but you need to add parens right now.

You probably only want to use `fn(A)->B`, though. 


**Function type examples**

```
fn foo(a: int) -> f32 {
    return 0.0;
}
let bar: fn(int) -> f32 = foo; 
let baz: &(fn(int) -> f32) = &foo;
```

### Closures

The type of a closure mapping something of type `A` to type `B` is `|A| -> B`. A closure with no arguments or return values has type `||`.


**Closure type examples**

```rust
let captured_var = 10; 
let closure_no_args = || println!("captured_var={}", captured_var); 
let closure_args = |arg: int| -> int {
  println!("captured_var={}, arg={}", captured_var, arg); 
  arg
};

// closure_no_args has type ||
// closure_args has type |int| -> int

fn call_closure(c1: ||, c2: |int| -> int) {
  c1();
  c2(2);
}

call_closure(closure_no_args, closure_args);
```

### Raw pointers

For any type `T`, `*T` is a type.
