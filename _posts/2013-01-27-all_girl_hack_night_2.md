title: "Montreal All-Girl Hack Night #2: now with cookies"
layout: post
---

The second hack night was as awesome as the
first one -- I worked on making music with arduinos with
[Floh](http://flohdot.org/), and other people worked on a netflix
autocompleter, a [keyboard music-making program in
clojure](https://github.com/linse/keymusix), learning R, and some
other things I didn't catch since I was too busy coding.

Turns out using a piezo speaker to make music is pretty easy!

To encourage people to do more coding, we gave cookies to everyone who
coded. As a a result, there was way more coding :) And there may be a
workshop next time!

<!--more-->

A few things:

* less people came this time, but I'm blaming that on the cold :)
* We made a wall of postits with programming project ideas. I'm not
  totally sure if anyone actually got any programming ideas from it,
  but it was a good conversation starter
* Someone came up to us after and offered to give an R workshop next
  time! Yay!
* We gave cookies to anyone who was anywhere near a computer or looked
  like they might be looking at code
* Some people still seemed to want more of a theme or direction for
  what to work on
* It continued to cost about $80. Yay!

Next month: Google Montreal is hosting!
