I've been working remote for 2 weeks now. The things that have surprised
me the most are

- I'm less lonely and disconnected than I expected (it turns out I'm
  an extrovert...)
- how well remote pairing works!

I did a lot of pair programming while at
[Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) and I found it to be a
really productive way to work. When I got a remote job (I live im
Montreal and work with people mostly in SF), I thought it would be
impossible to do pairing, or at the very least it would be a terrible
experience.

This is not so! Here's what I've been using:

<!-- more -->

- [tmate](http://tmate.io/) for sharing my terminal (I use vim in the
  terminal). The other person only needs a ssh client to use tmate.
- Google Hangouts or Skype for talking, and sometimes for
  screensharing
- an internal alias `http://go/julia` that redirects to a Google
  hangout to make it extra easy to talk to me
- a lot of scheduling pairing dates with Google calendar

My experience so far with Google Hangouts / Skype is that neither one
is really better, and both of them sometimes don't work. I tried
[appear.in](http://appear.in) once and that didn't work *at all*. One
person's sound and video was 2 minutes behind the entire time.

tmate mostly works beautifully. Sometimes it will work perfectly and
it's amazing and sometimes it will freeze for me 5 times in an hour.
I'm not sure if it doesn't like inconsistent internet connections or
what. The other problem with tmate is that some people have security
concerns with it, so I'm thinking of making an internal tmate that
goes through our servers.

I've also been using screensharing to remote pair. Screensharing is
great because it means you can use any editor you want (not just a
terminal editor), you can use more than one window, and nobody needs
any special software. Both Skype and Google Hangouts have it and
they're both a little wonky. A lot of people have retina Macbooks
and their screen resolution is way higher than mine, so I have to ask
them to zoom in a lot. The bigger you make the text, the less you'll
have trouble when the internet connection wavers.

If you're screensharing, be proactive about asking your partner to
zoom in :)

The worst thing about remote pairing is that it's really disruptive to
the flow of the pairing session when your internet connection keeps
dropping or if one of your tools freezes, and that never happens with
in-person pairing.

As long as the technology works, though, remote pairing has been
great! I find that it feels just as productive than in-person pairing,
which surprised me a lot. The only thing I wish for is an extra
screen so I could see my pairing-partner's face at the same time.

Are you doing remote pairing? I'd love ideas of how to mitigate any of
the problems I'm having :) I'm [@bork](http://twitter.com/b0rk) on
