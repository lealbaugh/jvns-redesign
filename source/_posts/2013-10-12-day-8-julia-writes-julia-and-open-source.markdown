At Hacker School this batch there is a wonderful thing called the
[maintainers program](https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/23-announcing-the-hacker-school-maintainers-program).
This means that lovely open source project maintainers come help Hacker
Schoolers contribute to their projects!

Yesterday [Stefan Karpinski](http://karpinski.org/) came to talk about
[Julia](http://julialang.org). Some reasons I'm excited about working on
Julia:

* The potential for "Julia works on Julia in Julia"
* Much of the code for Julia is written in Julia, unlike in Python where
  if you want to write fast code you have to write it in C. This seems
  pretty huge to me.
* The community seems really nice
* I'm into scientific computing & data science, and that's what it's for
* There's a [DataFrames](http://juliastats.github.com/DataFrames.jl)
  library for Julia, which I've already contributed a tiny bit to!
* I love the IPython Notebook to death, and Julia has a backend for it
  so that there's an IJulia Notebook! <3 <3 <3

However:

The thing I forgot about open source is that open source (for me!) is
*scary* and *hard*.  Discussing bugs on mailing lists and issue trackers
and submitting pull requests is *terrifying*. I have gone to awesome
code sprints with really lovely supportive people and gone home and
cried because being new to a project and trying to get work done is
sometimes *so frustrating*. Like you can spend 12 hours trying to fix a
tiny bug and get *nowhere*. And say ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE CONFUSED
AND WRONG. IN PUBLIC.

HOWEVER!

This is *why I'm at Hacker School*. And I'm going to work on lots of
open source anyway and write code and make pull requests and then it
will not be terrifying. I think Julia is a pretty good place to do this.
And pairing with people makes doing this stuff way easier.

AND I MADE PULL REQUESTS TODAY.
