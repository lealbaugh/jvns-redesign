Today was the first day of [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com).
There were tons of amazing people and it was fun and a bit overwhelming.

I paired with [Daphne](https://github.com/lifeissweetgood) on a shell in
C which is called [_dash](https://github.com/lifeissweetgood/_dash)
right now. She is fantastic and taught me tons of things about C.

When trying to tokenize strings in our shell, we ran into a super
unintuitive bug.  Here's the [gist](https://gist.github.com/jvns/6772832) of it:
<!-- more -->

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void set_strings(char*** strings) {
  char* strs[] = {"banana"};
  *strings = strs;
}

int main() {
  char** strings;
  set_strings(&strings);
  printf("First print: '%s'\n", strings[0]);
  char* s = "abc";
  printf("Second print: '%s'\n", strings[0]);
}
```

So this looks like normal code that would print "banana" twice. But
here's what actually happens:

```text
bork@kiwi ~/w/h/gists> gcc write-to-stack.c&& ./a.out
First print: 'banana'
Second print: 'UH�WAVAUE1TE1H�H�'
```

As I understand it, this is because this line:

<code>
char* strs[] = {"banana"};
</code>

gets allocated on the *stack* and not on the *heap*. So the pointer in
`strings` points to the stack and when you do something like setting a
variable, it becomes something weird. It took us a while to figure out
what was going on. YAY!

It's sort of exciting to get bugs that are (as far as I know) totally
impossible in Python.
