For a long time I had a vague feeling that I *should* be contributing
to open source more, and that it was in some way a Good Thing. And I
felt a little bit guilty about not doing it enough.

I used to have this dialog with myself pretty often:

* Okay, Julia, open source is good!
* Yeah, I should go do some open source
* What project? I don't know. huh.
* I use [Pidgin](https://www.pidgin.im/)! Maybe that
* *go look at pidgin*
* so many issues! I don't even know where to start
* and it's in C! so many code! how do I even!
* Give up, feel vaguely guilty

I'm trying to stop feeling guilty. Now if I'm going to contribute to a
project, it needs to be something that I'm motivated to do.
[Mel Chua](http://blog.melchua.com/) gave a great talk at Hacker
School where she said motivation is made up of *competence* (I know
how to do this!), *autonomy* (I can make my own decisions!), and
*relatedness* (I know why I'm doing this!).

In open source there's pretty high autonomy -- nobody's ever going to
force you to work on anything. So what's usually missing is
*relatedness* and *competence*.

For relatedness, I'll ask myself:


**"What do I hope to get out of contributing to this project?**

* I want to know how it works! (contributing to Linux could be super
  fun for this reason! Operating systems are amazing! My
  [gunzip in julia](https://github.com/jvns/gzip.jl) is a project
  where I learned a ton.)
* I found a bug and I want to fix it! I want to add a feature!
* I want to build up a portfolio of programming work to get better
  jobs!
* I think this project is doing important work and I'd like to advance
  it! (Kelsey Gilmore-Innis's work on the
  [Anti-Eviction Mapping Project](http://antievictionmappingproject.net/)
  is a great example)
* I like spending time with the people who work on this project! (When
  I went to Drupal conferences, all the Drupal devs were totally
  lovely people and really made me want to contribute to Drupal)

For competence, I'll ask:

**Is there anything that will stop me from getting work done?**

* Do I know the language this is written in? Is it easy to learn?
* Can I set up a dev environment easily on my computer?
* How complex is the codebase? Is it approachable? Is the
  documentation good?
* If I don't know something I need to know, will the community answer
  my questions? Will they be jerks? Is the mailing list active?

## why I don't

I usually don't contribute to open source because of *relatedness* --
I don't know what I'll get out of it! A super great example of this is
Drupal. [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) is a tremendously important
project. I've contributed to it before! I could do it again! The
community is extraordinarily welcoming! But it's missing *relatedness*
for me right now -- I'm not developing websites anymore.

Most open source projects fails relatedness -- if I don't use it,
don't want to learn about it right now, don't know anyone who works on
it, and/or don't believe strongly in its mission, I probably don't
want to contribute! This is TOTALLY OKAY. There are tons of people who
are contributing to those projects! They will be okay without me =)

A great example of a project that fails competence is Pidgin, above --
I might have had some issue with my chat client that I wanted to fix,
but the barrier to entry seemed too high at the time.

## why I do!

Here are some open source-y projects I have worked on and why:

* [IPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython), because there was a
  feature I wanted it to have that it didn't! Now it does! One of my
  PRs got merged into IPython and it is SUPER COOL.
* A [pandas cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook),
  because when I learned pandas there weren't as many practical
  materials as I wanted! Now there's one more! People are learning
  more about pandas because I wrote a thing! THE BEST.
* [gzip in julia](https://github.com/jvns/gzip.jl), to learn how gzip
  worked. Now I know! AWESOME.

Working on open source projects can be super fun! Yay!

## don't feel guilty

There are so many things you could be doing. If it takes 30 hours of
your time over 3 weeks to fix a network card issue, maybe that's
worthwhile because you learned a lot and your hardware works better!
Or maybe you would rather spend that time with your family or friends
or volunteering or playing soccer or watching movies or working to pay
your rent.

I sometimes hear people say "you should write open source software!"
like it's a universal good. Don't. Do it if it makes sense for you! Do
it if you know what you'll get out of it, and you feel that it's worth
your time! If not, do other things instead!
