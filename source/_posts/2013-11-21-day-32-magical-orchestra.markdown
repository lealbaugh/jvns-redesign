This week [Lyndsey](http://github.com/Apophenia) and I worked on a
[*★★★ Magical Orchestra ★★★*](https://github.com/jvns/magical-orchestra)
in Clojure.

The idea behind a *★★★ Magical Orchestra ★★★* is that you go to
`http://my-ip:8080/client.html`, and then you get a page that looks like
this:

Then a sound plays on my computer! Like a crow, or a cowbell.

So at presentations we plugged my computer into a speaker and let
everyone make noise. It was delightful.

If you are so inclined, you can have your very own magical orchestra
by cloning the repo above, installing Leinengen, and running `lein run`.
